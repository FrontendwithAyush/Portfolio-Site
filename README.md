### ✅ What You Should Do Next

1. Replace the placeholder `[your link]`, `[your email]`, etc. with your actual info.
2. If your site is deployed, **share the link with me**, and I’ll help add your exact link and screenshot.
3. Add a nice screenshot (`portfolio-preview.png`) for the preview section if you want to show your design on GitHub.

Let me know once you update or if you want help writing any of the sections like “About Me” or uploading your resume PDF.
